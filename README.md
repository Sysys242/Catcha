# Catcha
A simple captcha system - you need to select all cat image :o

## Dev note
Valid image are in /image/ and bad in /badimage/
I recommand you to obfuscate the libs01.js file, bc else skid can easily find a method to bypass it without any ia
I recommand you to change some value, like "true" and "false" for image validation with random char
And make your own fucking implementation system
